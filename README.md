# Crew
These are the people that have joined luffy's crew through out the anime. Each one of them has a crazy backstory and they all have a goal they are trying to achive just like Luffy. They are extremely reliable and are one of the most powerfull groups in all of One Piece.

This man built the ship, and is the inventor of most the gadgets and is the shipwrite. He joined because of his connection with the other group members and because he had gained a bounty which would put his other friens in danger.

He has not officialy joined the crew in the anime but he has already accepted his offer to join once he finishes something improtant he needs to do. Before this he was working for the government to protect his home island.

### Characters that might join the crew in the future
these characters have already met with luffy and the gang, but have had other matters to atend to so they couldnt join the group even if they were asked to. the reason why i belive these characters might join is because they got along great with the rest of the crew. In my opinion it is more likely for the next character to join would be female because there are currently only two females and eight males.
