This is the main character of One Piece and is the captain of the straw hat crew. One of his biggest gaols in life is to become the pirate king. He became a pirate because he loved the freedom and because he looked up to a great pirate, red hair Shanks.
# Crew
These are the people that have joined luffy's crew through out the anime. Each one of them has a crazy backstory and they all have a goal they are trying to achive just like Luffy. They are extremely reliable and are one of the most powerfull groups in all of One Piece.

### Characters that might join the crew in the future
these characters have already met with luffy and the gang, but have had other matters to atend to so they couldnt join the group even if they were asked to. the reason why i belive these characters might join is because they got along great with the rest of the crew. In my opinion it is more likely for the next character to join would be female because there are currently only two females and eight males.
